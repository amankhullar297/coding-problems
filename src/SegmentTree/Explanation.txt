Segment trees are used to solve range related problems.
Consider we have an array [0....n-1]

And we need to find:
         1. Find then sum of elements from l to r.
         2. Find the minimum element from l to r.

We can easily solve above problems using segment trees in optimal ways.

Representation of Segment trees:

Segment tree can be represented using array kinda similar as heaps representation.
For each node at index i, the left child is 2*i+1, right child is 2*i+2 and the parent is (i-1)/2.

1. Leaf nodes are the elements of the array.
2. Internal nodes are the merging of leaf nodes or internal nodes. Merging can be on sum, min etc of leaf nodes,
   depending upon the requirement.

Segment tree for input [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11] is represented as:


                             36
                           [ 0-5 ]
                          /       \
                         9        27
                       [0-2]     [3-5]
                      /    \     /   \
                     4      5   16    11
                   [0-1]       [3-4]
                  /     \      /   \
                 1       3    7     9
